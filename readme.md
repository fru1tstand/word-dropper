# WordDropper
It's a take on the old PopCap game Bookworm.

### Game Modes
###### Classic
**Goal**

Reach the next level by filling the progress bar by creating words. You
have a limited number of moves (created words) before your game ends.

**Mechanics**
+ Number of moves is persistent between levels
+ Every level up you get added a determined amount of moves based on difficulty and game level.
+ Every n levels you get a board scramble power up

**Levels**
+ Easy - A lot of moves per level, scrambles every 5 levels
+ Medium - A moderate number of moves per level, scrambles every 5 levels
+ Hard - A few moves per level, scrambles every 10 levels
+ Scholar - A few moves per level, no scrambles
	

	
###### Zen
**Goal**

Make words to your heart's content

**Mechanics**
+ Unlimited moves per level
+ Unlimited scrambles
